Hello!

There are 3 code files
1. main.py - actual python code
2. chord_progression.txt - where the user inputs the chord progression
3. sheet_music.ly - where the lilypond code is generated

sheet_music.pdf is the pdf file generated with the scales after running the program. 

I ran lilypond through frescobaldi. 
I have not included all the various chord types. This project was just a challenge to see how I would go about creating a fully funcitonal program with basic parameters. 

Enjoy!
