Hello!

There are 3 code files
1. main.py - actual python code
2. chord_progression.txt - where the user inputs the chord progression
3. sheet_music.ly - where the lilypond code is generated

sheet_music.pdf is the pdf file generated with the scales after running the program. 

I ran lilypond through frescobaldi

Enjoy!
